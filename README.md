Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

This is a challenge involving Web APIs to create a trivia game about programming knowledge. When taking the quiz, the user should be able to click a start button, in which causes a timer to stat counting down and a question should appear. Once a question is answered, the user should be presented with another question. When a question is answered incorrectly, time should be subtracted from the clock. Once all questions have been answered, or the timer reaches 0, the game should end. The user should then be able to enter their initials and score to be saved under a list of high scores.

Screenshots of the application can be found in the Screenshots folder in the repository.
